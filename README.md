## Introduction
The code for this website was given by the Instructors at the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp for an accessability and code refactoring assignement. The goal was to take the initial code and improve it to meet the acceptance criteria. My goal of the project was to learn and make the website as accessible as possible by adding in semantic elements and cleaning up any inefficient code.
