# gt-responsive-portfolio
## Introduction
This website was created as a project for the Georgia Tech Coding Full-Stack program. The goal of this project was to learn and apply the concepts of responsive web design. Here I have created a responsive portfolio that contains an About Me, Portfolio with links to other projects and a Contact page. I utilized bootstrap and semantic html elements to create it.

### Usage
The website was designed to be responsive. The "About Me" page is the home page. The user can either click on the links above to go to the other sections of the site or, if their screen is small, can click the hamburger drop down and access the links that way. Note, the pictures in the Portfolio sections are links to other websites.
